# Business Finance Tracker with A.I

## Introduction

The Business Finance Tracker is an AI-powered application designed to track and manage financial data for businesses. This documentation provides an overview of the key features, technologies used, and implementation details of the tracker.

## Key Features

1. **Real-time Tracking**

2. **Accurate Predictions**

3. **Insightful Reports**

4. **Visually Appealing Graphs**:

5. **GPT-like Chatbot**

## Technologies Used

The Business Finance Tracker is developed using the following technologies:

- **TypeScript**: TypeScript is used as the programming language for the application, providing strong typing and improved code maintainability.

- **Node.js**: Node.js is utilized as the runtime environment to execute JavaScript code on the server-side, allowing for efficient backend development.

- **MongoDB**: MongoDB serves as the database management system, providing a flexible and scalable solution for storing financial data.

- **LangChain**: LangChain is a natural language processing library used for processing user queries and enabling conversational access to the database through the chatbot.

- **Hugging Face Pre-trained Language Model**: The GPT-like chatbot utilizes a pre-trained language model called google/flan-t5-base from Hugging Face, which is fine-tuned for the specific use case of the Business Finance Tracker. This model enables the chatbot to understand and respond to user queries effectively.

- **Mui**: Mui (Material-UI) is a React UI library that offers pre-built components and styling options, ensuring a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.

- **React.js**: React.js is the frontend JavaScript library employed to build the user interface of the Finance Tracker, enabling dynamic rendering and efficient state management.

## Implementation Details

1. **Real-time Tracking Modules**: The real-time tracking modules are implemented using Node.js and MongoDB. They continuously monitor and collect financial data from various sources, ensuring the most up-to-date information is available for analysis.

2. **ML Predictions**: The accurate predictions are achieved by incorporating a machine learning algorithms(linear regression). The financial data is fed into the linear regression to predict future trends and outcomes.

3. **Comprehensive Reporting**: The reporting feature is implemented using React.js and Mui. It dynamically generates reports based on the analyzed financial data, presenting them in an organized and visually appealing format(Balance sheet and Profit & Loss).

4. **GPT-like Chatbot**: The GPT-like chatbot is developed using LangChain and the Hugging Face pre-trained language model. It understands user queries, retrieves relevant financial information from the database, and provides responses in a conversational manner.


## Limitations

  The GPT-like chatbot can not process newly added informations to the database. This is because the langchain model has already process the current data in the database and therefore can only provide information about that.However to get around this, new information can be added directly in the backend and retrain the model


## Conclusion

The Business Finance Tracker is a powerful tool for businesses to track, manage, and analyze financial data. By leveraging AI technologies, real-time tracking, insightful reporting, and the Hugging Face pre-trained language model, it enables accurate predictions, informed decision-making, and conversational access to the financial database.
